You are an expert in Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) and JSON translation. Your task is to re-translate a PPI that previously caused errors during execution.

## Context:
- PPI Name: {0}
- Previous Error: {1}
- Log Activities: {2}
- Log Attributes: {3}

## Your Task:
Re-translate the PPI named "{0}" into a valid JSON structure that will execute without errors.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- This is a TIME-BASED PPI - use "begin" and "end" fields
- `aggregation` can ONLY be: "total", "minimum", "maximum", "average"
- DO NOT use "metric_condition" field (only valid for count PPIs)
- DO NOT use "percentage" as aggregation (only for count PPIs)
- Only use activity names that exist in the provided log activities list: {2}
- Only use attribute names that exist in the provided log attributes list: {3}
- Only use `group_by` with attribute names that exist in the provided log attributes list: {3}
- AVOID using `filter` with AND/OR conditions - keep filters simple
- If the previous error mentioned a non-existent column, DO NOT use that column
- If the previous error mentioned undefined variables, DO NOT use filters with complex conditions

## Time-Based PPI Structure:
```json
{{
    "PPIname": "[write the PPI name]",
    "PPIjson": {{
        "begin": "activity == '[activity name from log]'",
        "end": "activity == '[activity name from log]'",
        "aggregation": "[total|minimum|maximum|average]"
        "filter": "[simple condition without AND/OR]" - Only if it references a valid single condition otherwise omit it,
        "group_by": "[attribute name]" - Only if the attribute exists in the log otherwise omit it
    }}
}}
```


## Guidelines for Re-translation:
1. **Understand the PPI intent**: Based on the PPI name "{0}", determine what time measurement is needed
2. **Select valid activities**: Choose "begin" and "end" activities from the available list
3. **Choose appropriate aggregation**: Select from total, minimum, maximum, or average
4. **Keep it simple**: Use filter only if it references a valid single condition otherwise omit it, use group_by only if the attribute exists in the log otherwise omit it
5. **Learn from the error**: If the previous error was "{1}", make sure to avoid that issue

## Common Patterns:
- **Average time between two activities**: 
  - `"begin": "activity == 'First Activity'"`
  - `"end": "activity == 'Second Activity'"`
  - `"aggregation": "average"`

- **Total time for a specific activity**:
  - `"begin": "activity == 'Activity Name'"`
  - `"end": ""`
  - `"aggregation": "total"`

- **Minimum/Maximum time for an activity**:
  - `"begin": "activity == 'Activity Name'"`
  - `"end": ""`
  - `"aggregation": "minimum"` or `"maximum"`

## Output Format:
Return ONLY a single JSON object (not an array) representing the corrected PPI. Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or additional text.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Start your response immediately with the opening brace `{{`
- End your response with the closing brace `}}`
- Use proper JSON formatting with double quotes for all strings
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON
- Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks
- Return a SINGLE JSON object, not an array

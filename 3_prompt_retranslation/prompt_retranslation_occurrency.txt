You are an expert in Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) and JSON translation. Your task is to re-translate a PPI that previously caused errors during execution.

## Context:
- PPI Name: {0}
- Previous Error: {1}
- Log Activities: {2}
- Log Attributes: {3}

## Your Task:
Re-translate the PPI named "{0}" into a valid JSON structure that will execute without errors.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- This is a COUNT/OCCURRENCE-BASED PPI - use "count" field
- `aggregation` can be: "total", "minimum", "maximum", "average", or "percentage"
- If `aggregation` is "percentage", you MUST include `"metric_condition": "> 0"`
- DO NOT use "begin" or "end" fields (only for time PPIs)
- Only use activity names that exist in the provided log activities list: {2}
- Only use attribute names that exist in the provided log attributes list: {3}
- AVOID using `group_by` unless absolutely necessary and the column exists in attributes
- AVOID using `filter` with AND/OR conditions - keep filters simple or omit them
- If the previous error mentioned a non-existent column, DO NOT use that column
- If the previous error mentioned undefined variables, DO NOT use filters with complex conditions

## Count/Occurrence PPI Structure:
```json
{{
    "PPIname": "[write the PPI name]",
    "PPIjson": {{
        "count": "activity == '[activity name from log]'",
        "aggregation": "[total|minimum|maximum|average|percentage]"
    }}
}}
```

**If aggregation is "percentage":**
```json
{{
    "PPIname": "[write the PPI name]",
    "PPIjson": {{
        "count": "activity == '[activity name from log]'",
        "metric_condition": "> 0",
        "aggregation": "percentage"
    }}
}}
```

**Optional fields (use ONLY if safe):**
- `"filter": "[simple condition without AND/OR]"` - Only if it references a valid single condition
- `"group_by": "[attribute name]"` - Only if the attribute exists in the log

## Guidelines for Re-translation:
1. **Understand the PPI intent**: Based on the PPI name "{0}", determine what count/occurrence measurement is needed
2. **Select valid activity**: Choose the activity to count from the available list
3. **Choose appropriate aggregation**: Select from total, minimum, maximum, average, or percentage
4. **Add metric_condition if needed**: If using "percentage", add `"metric_condition": "> 0"`
5. **Keep it simple**: Avoid complex filters and group_by unless absolutely necessary
6. **Learn from the error**: If the previous error was "{1}", make sure to avoid that issue

## Common Patterns:
- **Total count of an activity**: 
  - `"count": "activity == 'Activity Name'"`
  - `"aggregation": "total"`

- **Average occurrences of an activity**:
  - `"count": "activity == 'Activity Name'"`
  - `"aggregation": "average"`

- **Percentage of cases with an activity**:
  - `"count": "activity == 'Activity Name'"`
  - `"metric_condition": "> 0"`
  - `"aggregation": "percentage"`

## Output Format:
Return ONLY a single JSON object (not an array) representing the corrected PPI. Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or additional text.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Start your response immediately with the opening brace `{{`
- End your response with the closing brace `}}`
- Use proper JSON formatting with double quotes for all strings
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON
- Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks
- Return a SINGLE JSON object, not an array

**REMEMBER: Keep the translation simple and avoid complex conditions that might cause errors.**

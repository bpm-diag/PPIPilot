You are an expert in process mining and PPI (Process Performance Indicator) translation.

A PPI named "{0}" has caused an error during execution:
ERROR: {1}

Your task is to re-translate this PPI into a valid JSON structure that will execute successfully.

AVAILABLE ACTIVITIES IN THE LOG:
{2}

AVAILABLE ATTRIBUTES IN THE LOG:
{3}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Only use group_by with attribute names that exist in the provided log attributes list
2. AVOID using filter parameters unless absolutely necessary
3. Use simple, straightforward conditions
4. Prefer "average" as aggregation when in doubt
5. Do not use complex AND/OR conditions in filters

Please return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "PPIname": "name of the PPI",
  "PPIjson": {
    "begin": "activity condition for start",
    "end": "activity condition for end",
    "aggregation": "average"
  }
}

Remember: Keep the translation simple and avoid the error that occurred previously.
